## Before 3.21
During the winter vacation, we held several online meetings to discuss the basic structure of the whole project and what technologies might be needed. During each meeting, the team members exchanged information about what new technologies they had learned and how much they had learned. In this process, we screened out tools or frameworks that we were good at and were convenient for project development, and focused on research in the following time.

## 3.21
At the beginning of the project, the Wechat mini-program is divided into two parts: front end and back end. The front-end requirements are Frame Forming and User Login /sign up respectively, to develop the UI framework. The back-end work is database establishing. To better schedule member's work during agile development, we used Pingcode to push the project.

## 3.23
In the past two days, we have developed the framework and JPA Interface in the front end. Primary database was also created, which is currently in the testing phase. Today we had our second meeting, connecting the work of the front end and back-end teams. We further negotiated the UI design on the basis of the front-end framework and nailed down some details.

## 3.25
Before the meeting began, the group responsible for developing the front-end showed the rest of the team what they had done: user registration, login and related pages. The group responsible for developing the back-end has completed the programming of the class and Service Controller Interface for the user related functions. In this meeting, we mainly discussed how to connect the front and back-ends through interfaces and plan to implement this in the near future.

## 3.27
This was a short team routine meeting where we briefly discussed the progress of the front-end and back-end groups. In the past, the front-end group has done page development related to user information. The back-end group completed the development of the class and Controller Server Interface related to the stadium, and tested the related functions.

## 3.28
Again, it was a brief meeting focused on progress exchange. In the past two days, the front-end group completed the page development related to the recharge module. The back-end group completed the development of the class and Controller Server Interface related to the stadium facilities, also tested the related functions.


## 3.31
Over the past few days, instead of continuing to develop new front-end pages, the front-end group has been testing the finished pages to make sure they work properly with the back-end in future. After team members checked in the meeting, we found no bugs in the front-end part. The back-end group continued to work on the functionality, completing the activity related class and Controller Server Interface development prior to this meeting.
